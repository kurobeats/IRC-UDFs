IRC-UDFs
========

AutoIt IRC UDFs, UDFs to connect to IRC using TCP Functions, as well as perform actions once connected.


Notes:

  Originally created by Chip.
  UDF Headers Updated compared to old script.
  Error and Parameter Handling Update compared to old script.
  If you need to bypass the RFC compliance of this UDF, use _IRCRaw.
  These commands should work on every server following either RFC 1459 (legacy) or RFC 2812 (preferred).
  The majority of the old functions have been modified. It will break most, if not all, scripts using the old UDF.
